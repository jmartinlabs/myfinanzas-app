description: Specify a roadmap epic by number or a new feature by name through resumable brainstorming; never implement code.

# spec

## Inputs
Read `AGENTS.md`, `specs/README.md`, existing state and applicable guidelines before acting.
Functional delegates also follow [the functional role](../../roles/functional.md) and their work packet.
## Outputs
`specs/{nr}-{slug}-brainstorming.md` and `specs/{nr}-{slug}-specification.md`,
with a two-digit number, approved decisions and a local documentation commit.
## Procedure
1. Read roadmap, product context, architecture, quality, security and applicable UI
   guidelines. Resolve the requested epic number or feature name. Ask if ambiguous.
   Reuse its existing identifier/files; otherwise allocate the next unused two-digit
   number and unique lowercase slug. Never overwrite another feature.
2. Start or resume brainstorming from `templates/brainstorming.md`. Read all prior
   questions/confirmed answers. Append one question round at a time; never rewrite
   history. Use Markdown checkboxes, e.g. `- [x] Recommended option — rationale` and
   `- [ ] Alternative — trade-off`. A checked recommendation is a proposal, not a user
   answer. Separately record confirmed answers and their approval source/date. A functional
   delegate may create and append to these brainstorming files within its packet; it never
   marks them approved or rewrites confirmed history.
3. Stop and wait for the user after each unanswered round. Do not invent answers.
   Cover functional requirements, screens/interactions, data read/written, APIs/external
   dependencies, validation, errors and edge cases. Ask only unresolved questions.
4. For visual applications append ASCII wireframes and obtain feedback before finalizing.
   For non-visual systems describe the relevant interfaces without requiring screens.
5. Once required decisions are confirmed, use `templates/specification.md`: expected
   functionality, data model/contracts, interfaces, empty/loading/error states, API
   behavior when applicable, validation, exclusions and numbered acceptance checks.
   Every check says what to do and what result to expect; assign stable AC-01 style IDs.
   A functional delegate may write draft specification sections and acceptance criteria
   within its packet; the user still approves.
6. Request approval of the complete specification. Only the user approves. After approval,
   review the diff and commit approved brainstorming/specification files only; a functional
   delegate returns the approval request and draft evidence to the coordinator, which records
   approval and commits the approved documents. Never self-approve or commit a draft as
   approved. Preserve unrelated user changes. Return approval evidence and dependency changes
   to the coordinator, which owns the shared epic board.
## Stop conditions
Pause on unanswered questions, unapproved wireframes/specification or important conflicts.
Preserve history and next action for resumption. Do not implement the feature. After the
approved documentation commit, stop and explain how to continue with `$dev` and its ID.
